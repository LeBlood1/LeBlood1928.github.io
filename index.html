        is the hightlight and goal of every professional athelete. I worked my whole life for it already and I will do anything necessary in the future 
    to achieve this</p>    

    <br>I managed to establish myself already on the world stage in the last 2 years. After getting 20th at the <a href="https://www.fina.org/competitions/11/fina-diving-world-cup-2021">World Cup 2020</a> in Tokyo,
        I was able to show my potential again at the <a href="https://www.fina.org/competitions/2902/19th-fina-world-championships-budapest-2022">World Championships 2022</a> in Budapest.
        
    <p>Qualifying to the semifinals of the <b>Top 18 in the world</b> is like a dream come to for me and I am hungry to achieve more</p>
